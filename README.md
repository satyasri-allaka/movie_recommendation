# movie_recommendation
Recommendation systems are now used everywhere in every website. For example, product suggestions on shopping webistes like Amazon, Netflix, and Myntra, songs suggestions in Spotify,Gaana and Wynk websites, and movie recommendations in Amazon prime, Netflix, and Youtube and many more. 

In this project, I have built the movie recommendation system using NLP, machine learning and cosine similarity method.
